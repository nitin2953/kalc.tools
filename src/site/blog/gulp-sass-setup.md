# What is Gulp and SCSS?
Gulp is a well known task runner for frontend development. It is a tool that helps you automate repetitive tasks in your development workflow.
Being used by BIG Tech Giants to small scale developers, many newcomers don't use gulp when they start their web development career.
But let me tell you that Gulp is so easy to learn and use, it only require a little bit of javacsript knowledge to get up and running within a few minutes (or few hours if you have started writing javascript this week).
